====================

This project requires a user to install and configure a Neo4j database. I do not discuss how to do that because the documentation at neo4j.org is supurb and I am just beginning to use that resource in my research. 

The Python requires installation of additional packages: iGraph (python-igraph) and Py2Neo (py2neo).
